I am currently working on 3D vision with [Ayush Tewari](https://ayushtewari.com) and [Vincent Sitzmann](https://vincentsitzmann.com) at MIT. I graduated from the University of Delaware in 2024 and I am in-between undergrad and PhD at the moment. I am deeply interested in 3D generalization (or lack thereof) and robotics applications.

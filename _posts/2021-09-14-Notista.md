### Key Takaways
In order to practice and learn JavaScript, HTML and CSS, I followed a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01YKQmia2Jw) that builds a note taking app (yes, another one) using pure vanilla JS. 


#### Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) Architecture 
What is interesting was the app architecture. Specifically, there were three separate JS files which each handled a specific functionality of the app, specifically: 
* ``NotesView.js`` - Handled all UI functionality and interacted directly with the DOM of the webpage by inserting and manipulating HTML. View in MVVM
* ``App.js`` - Acted as boundary between NotesView and NotesAPI by calling and receiving data from NotesAPI and sending data to NotesView. ViewModel in MVVM
* ``NotesAPI.js`` - Interacted directly with localstorage as a "database". Model or Repository in MVVM. 

To learn more about MVVM, [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel)

#### CSS 
The CSS made it look very *professional*. It used flexbox which I hope to learn more about. 

#### HTML and JavaScript
I learnt so much about HTML and JavaScript separately and also how they  can work together. 
* Custom data properties were used to track ids of each note. 
* ``localstorage`` can be used to store data locally. 
* General JS syntax like ``arr.ForEach(function)`` or ``arr.find(predicate)``
* Structuring HTML with ``div`` elements and proper ``class`` names or when to use ``id``
  
### Lastly
I hope to be able, without following a tutorial, implement a Todo application (yes, very creative I know ... ) usign the same concepts and vanilla JS. 

Overall it was a very fun project to build and tutorial to follow.

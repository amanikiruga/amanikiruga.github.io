## What I Did Differently
### Styling
Although I didn't drastically change the styling, it pretty much still looks like the original, only now there is no use of Bootsrap or NPM modules. Since I had just learned flexbox, i wanted to try and replicate the styling with only flexbox css. Specifically, replicating the two column layout. 

### Functionality
Since I didn't use the DND card list that Dr. Bart used, I also had to implement the dynamic list functionality including deleting. 

I also created the modal popup including the form text entry from scratch which I had implemented earlier as an independent React toy-project. 

## Things I learned and Technologies Used
To improve my **git** skills, I used branches to separate the original project from the tutorial and the modified one. 

Although it took a long time, the project made me learn the fundamentals of **TypeScript** and the difference of types vs interfaces, or when you can leave TypeScript to infer types. 

## Finally
I really enjoyed following Dr. Bart's tutorial as it was well explained and helped kickstart my learning of React and Typescript.
